# Digital_Clock
I have created this beginner level project by using C programming Language. It is basically a clock, which outputs in hh:mm:ss format and also we have to initially set the time as hh:mm:ss


To run this program: 
Step 1:  Download Visual Studio Code/ Sublime  or any other IDE
Step 2: Download Mingw
Step 3: Add the bin in path
Step 4: Open the program in IDE
Step 5: Run the program
Step 6: Set the initial Time in HH:MM:SS format
................................................................

Now it will show the output as HH:MM:SS
